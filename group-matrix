# This script shows a membership matrix of all users in the queried groups

USAGE="USAGE:   $0 AD_GROUP [AD_GROUP...]

Prints a matrix showing which members are in which group.
The script outputs pretty-printed tables if the output is the terminal
If the output goes to a file or pipe, a standard CSV format is emitted instead

Example terminal output:

# ./group-matrix group1 group2 group3
USERS  group1  group2  group3
user1  Y
user2  Y       Y       Y
user3  Y
user4  Y       Y

Example redirected output:
# ./group-matrix group1 group2 group3 | cat
USERS,group1,group2,group3
user1,Y,,
user2,Y,Y,Y
user3,Y,,
user4,Y,Y,
"

# check invocation
if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
  echo "Not enough arguments! (expected one or more AD-groups)"
  echo "$USAGE"
  exit 1
